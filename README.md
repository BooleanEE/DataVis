# Data Visualization
## UFMG 2024/01 
Data Visualization Final Assignment - Develop interactive visualizations

## System limitations

- It is intended to be running on a Ubunto (OS). It is possible that another library or different installation could be necessary on Windows Operational System or another OS;
- It is intended to be running with Python3.10.14. If the user try using another version, it is not guarantee to properly work with it. Additionally, all versions for all libraries used in this project must be the ones in the requirements.txt file.

## Makefile

- Make sure you have the make command installed in your machine and has it defined in your environment variable path, otherwise it it is not going to work;
- The command **make save** will save all libraries utilized in the project;  
- The command **make install** will install all dependecies necessaries to run the code.  
  
When using **make save** and **make install**, make sure that you are on you virtual environment.  

# Guide on how to run step-by-step the code  

## Before running the code  

1. You must ensure that you have the Visual Code installed in your machine or another application that can run a python code;  
2. You must ensure that you have Python 3.10.14 installed in your computer. It is not guaranteed that this will work with older versions (you can find it in here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31014/);  
3. You must create a virtual environment with Python 3.10.14  and chose it to use as your interpreter (Ctrl+Shift+P -- Python Interpreter) for running the application;  
4. You must get inside your new virtual environment and use the command **make install** to install all dependecies necessaries to run the code;  
5. If the make command is not working, you can install it manually or using the line **pip install -r requirements.txt**. 

## Running the application
